About Me

I’m a Software Engineer building reliable and scalable systems. I specialize in frontend development with React and Next.js using TypeScript, and backend services using Node.js (Express) and C#/.NET. I also have experience working with SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, and web proxies like Nginx and Traefik.

I enjoy exploring new technologies and continuously improving my craft. I thrive in Agile environments with TFS and Jira, contributing effectively through Git-based workflows and CI/CD pipelines.

🛠️ Technical Proficiency:

- Frontend: React, NextJS
- Backend: C# (.NET), Node (Express)
- Database: SQL (MSSQL, Postgre), NoSQL (MongoDB)
- Tools: Git, GitLab, TFS, Jira
- Others: Docker, Nginx, Traefik


Since I first started development as a hobby years ago, I still challenge myself with side projects while following my passions for strength training and flying drones.
